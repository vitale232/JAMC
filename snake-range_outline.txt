Ia.	Intro
	a.	Distributions of species are expected to change
	b.	Current data misses microrefugia
	c.	Topoclimate varies in time and space
	d.	Study goals/What we did



Ib.	Second intro
	a.	Importance of air temperature
	b.	Variation of temperature in space and time
	c.	General efforts to estimate temperature
		1)	Lapse rates
		2)	Gridded products
	d.	Study goals/What we did

Ic.	Third intro
	a.	Importance of air temperature
	b.	Variation of temperature in space and time
		1)	Spatial Variation
		2)	Temporal Variation
			i.	Seasonal effects
			ii.	Weather effects
	c.	General efforts to estimate temperature
		1)	Lapse rates
		2)	Gridded products
	d.	Study goals/What we did



II.	Methods
	a.	Study site
	b.	Synoptic weather
		1)	Range and seasonality of observed lapse rates
		2)	EOFs
	c.	Topographic variables
		1)	Elevation - Intuitive for most people
		2)	TCI - Cold air drainage
		3)	Irradiance - Modeled sunshine at each point
		4)	Canopy Cover - Best guestimate of canopy % cover
		5)	Slope - maybe more cold air drainage effect *[check correlation with TCI and irrad]*
	d.	Hierarchical models
		1)	Tmn
		2)	Tmx
	e.	Model Validation *[is 4 NevCAN stations a large enough dataset for validation?
						   at least it's very independent!]*

*[Results and discussion are kind of blurred together at this point. Should come together
better as I tighten up the methods while writing.]*
III.Results and discussion
	a.	Theoretical interpretation
		1)	Persistence of Tmn inversions
		2)	Difficulty identifying inversions in Tmx winter
		3)	...
		4)	...
	b.	Predictions
		1)	Tmn
		2)	Tmx

IV.	Discussion
	a.	Spatial-Temporal interactions and complications
		1)	Inversions more common in winter
		2) 	Tmn inversions more persistent
		3)	Lots of complicated statistics
			a.	This really applies to our dataset, 
				thus the challenge of understanding such 
				finely resolved climate remains lackluster at best.
			b.	This is cheap and easy to do, so a new
				age of understanding is around the corner.
