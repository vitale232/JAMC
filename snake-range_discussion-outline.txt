discussion outline

1.  Finescale variation of temperature within complex landscapes
    a.  Minimum temperature
        i.  Varies over short disances
        ii. Independent of elevation
        iii.CC?
    b.  Maximum temperature
        i.  Varies over short distances
        ii. More elevation Independent
        iii.CC
        iv. More affected by sensor design

2.  Synoptic weather and seasonality driving local temp regimes
    a.  Minimum temperature
        *   Quickly touch on tair
        i.  Persistent inversions throughout the year
        ii. Height of inversion likely varies
        iii.Atmospheric mixing
        iv. Lapse rate variability
        v.  PC4 and its effect
    b.  Maximum temperature
        *   Quickly touch on Tair
        i.  Only occassional inverisons
        ii. Height and timing of inversions varies (great source of uncertainty)
        iii.Atmospheric mixing
        iv. Lapse rate variability
        V.  PC4 and its effect
        
3.  Landscape features driving local temp regimes
    a.  Minimum temperature
        i.  Elevation and its quadratic
        ii. Weak effect of irradiance
        iii.TCI/slope
    b.  Maximum temperature
        i.  Elevation and its quadratic (weaker quad effect)
        ii. Strong effect of irradiance
        iii.TCI/Slope - slope stronger than TCI
4.  Microclimate considerations
5.  Touch on methods
